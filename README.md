# Example Guess a Word Game

This is a sample guess-a-word-game for my awesome students in the May 2018 UCLA Full Stack Web Development course. 

For anyone not in that course who happens upon this repository, please note that this is an example for simple vanilla Javascript and HTML, meaning there are no major Javascript frameworks or libraries used.
