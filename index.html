                A random word will be chosen for you to guess.

                    Note the "hide-when-started" class! 
                    This will be used in the javascript file as an easy utility to hide all desired elements when the game is started
                -->

            Now for the main layout. We'll want a split 2 column layout, with 1/3 on the left  and 2/3 right 
            We will give it the extra class of `show-when-started` to be used by the javascript later
            and the `d-none` class provided by bootstrap to hide the whole element when the page is initially loaded
        -->
        <div class="container show-when-started d-none">
            <div class="row">

                            In the left hand side, we'll show general game information
                            such as wins, losses, guesses left and what has been guessed.

                            Let's just put each piece of information in its own little `card`
                            I'm also using an extra set of classes to add some shadowing effect around the boxes.
                            Not the use of the classes: `shadow p3 mb-5 bg-white rounded` 
                        -->
                        <div class="card shadow p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded">
                            <div class="card-body">
                                <h5>Wins</h5>

                                    Note my use of the <span> tag here. 
                                    The <span> is the simplest HTML element for wrapping around a dynamic piece within a sentence.
                                    The `class="font-weight-bold"` is a bootstrap utility class to make the text bold.     

                                    (disclaimer: there are cleaner ways to output dynamic text within rich javascript applications but this exercise isn't practicing on that)
                                 -->
